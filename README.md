## Hi there ðŸ‘‹. My name is Shoaib Aziz. 
** Python | C | Git | Linux for GNC and space missions applications.

I am currently learning backend development with skills such as python, C, docker, SQL, OOPS, Linux, Git, DSA, Go.
I'm currently working on solving orbital mechanics problems in python and C. I am also learning HTTP clients and servers.
I am looking to collaborate on projects related to orbital mechanics/control and projects that offer an attractive blend of these concepts with the above stated backend skills.

My best project is a collaboration with three other people in which we made a smartphone based GNSS positiioning system. We collected raw GNSS data using our smartphones and computed our postions and trajectories from a constilations of satellites such as GPS, GLONAAS, Galileo and BDS. My contribution to the project was to analyse how the distribution of satellites induces the phenomena of dilution of precision such as HDOP, VDOP, GDOP etc. We found that how interferance from nearby obstacles such as buildings induce errors. We also found out interestingly that inheriently different phones offer different accuracy in the exact same environment. Our project was highly applauded by our professor.

Fun fact: I am a foreign language learning enthusiast with official B1 in Spanish and A2 in Russian. I really adore this skill of mine becuase communication with someone in their native tongue really gives us an upper hand in negotiations and moreover everyone appreciates the efforts a foreigner made to learn their language.
